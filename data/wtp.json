Sophie has studied in America, is a licensed attorney in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and is working as a legal associate for a non-profit.

Regrettably, her application for a work visa as a high-skilled immigrant was denied with no explanation and no opportunity to appeal or re-file. She loves America and its people deeply. For being here legally and playing by the rules, she is being punished. Please sign this petition to let Sophie stay.\nFor more information, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/LetSophieStay\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

The Phelps family and their supporters use these tax exempt funds to finance a country-wide campaign against any person or group they feel promotes values that do not meet with their own. Most prominently they are anti-gay.\nThe members of this hate group make a practice of targeting funerals to make their case, routinely inflicting further pain and anguish onto the mourning families of deceased soldiers and, even worse, the victims of tragic crimes. They hold signs thanking God and celebrating the deaths of these people. They wave these signs in the faces of the families.\nBy granting their tax exemption WE ARE FUNDING THEIR HATE.

In America, 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men have been victims, showing that cultural misunderstandings about sexual assault must be addressed. Education on sexual assault laws and statistics, what constitutes consent, and the resources available to survivors need to be given to youth across a wide age range as regular curriculum. Survivors must know how to get help and we must prevent more people from becoming victims. We want the Obama Administration to direct schools on information to cover, provide resources and grants in education for schools to have awareness activities and lessons, and to strongly encourage schools to participate in awareness education and a multiple grade levels.\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

The Employer Mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act will significantly escalate the cost of in-home care which will result in a barrier to access to care and force early institutionalization via nursing homes. We ask President Obama and the entire 113th Congress to EXEMPT the in-home care industry from the Employer Mandate provision of the ACA as a means of preserving the rights of the disabled and senior populations.\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

Many states have passed laws allowing credit for ASL classes as a foreign language but they have stopped short of recognizing its benefits as a language of instruction in schools, despite studies proving its benefits for students.\nOfficial federal recognition will finally give ASL the \"welcome home\" it needs.\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

The current government has developed a need for survival so large, that it fails to accept the will of the Venezuelan people. This translated into over three thousand documented occasions of voting irregularities, inhibiting the people from exercising their inalienable right to vote.\nIn a democratic state, there is no reason why the government should refuse to do a recount when such a large portion of the population demands it. That is why I urge the Obama Administration to refuse to accept the results of the Venezuelan presidential elections up until there has been a full recount. I furthermore urge it to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of any government until there is no doubt that the democratic process was honored.\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.
