    "text": "On August 15, 2012 Kathleen Mary Miskell was victim to an tragic parasailing accident, while on vacation in Pompano Beach Florida, when her harness broke due to lack of safety inspections and maintenance neglect. This is the second parasailing death in Pompano Beach since Amber White's accident in 2007. These terrible tragedies could easily be prevented if parasailing becomes a regulated watersport. This petition is not meant to close or inhibit any future parasailing however by government regulating this watersport it would be the safe and fun activity it is meant to be. Please support this cause to prevent any future accidents!\nKathleen Mary Miskell July 22, 1984 - August 15, 2012 Wethersfield - Kathleen Mary (Mulcahy) Miskell, 28 of Wethersfield, beloved wife of Stephen M.
