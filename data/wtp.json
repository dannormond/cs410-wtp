Kaiser, the other hospital, said the baby was healthy. 24 hours later, CPS showed up at their house. The police illegally entered their house under force, and ripped the child from the parents arms. CPS cited severe neglect and refuse to comment to the media other than to rely heavily on the information from healthcare provider. However, if they did, then they should have paid attention to Kaiser saying the child was safe. There wasn't an emergency situation, so without a warrant, so and the police violated the family's rights.\nhttp://www.news10.net/news/article/242734/2/Couple-fights-to-get-baby-back-from-CPS-police\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.
