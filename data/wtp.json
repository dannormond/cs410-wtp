We have found that the Criminal Complaint created by F.B.I. Special Agent Daniel R. Genck does not, in fact, coincide with the photos of the suspects on that day. Furthermore, 'We the People' have found it to be true that many statements given by officials involved with the case of the suspects have proven to be 'falsified' and should be investigated immediately.
