Sophie has studied in America, is a licensed attorney in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and is working as a legal associate for a non-profit.

Regrettably, her application for a work visa as a high-skilled immigrant was denied with no explanation and no opportunity to appeal or re-file. She loves America and its people deeply. For being here legally and playing by the rules, she is being punished.

The Phelps family and their supporters use these tax exempt funds to finance a country-wide campaign against any person or group they feel promotes values that do not meet with their own. Most prominently they are anti-gay.\nThe members of this hate group make a practice of targeting funerals to make their case, routinely inflicting further pain and anguish onto the mourning families of deceased soldiers and, even worse, the victims of tragic crimes. They hold signs thanking God and celebrating the deaths of these people. They wave these signs in the faces of the families.\nBy granting their tax exemption WE ARE FUNDING THEIR HATE.

Over the past few years it has come to light that many of the original charges were false or completely fabricated.\nYet despite this new information, the United States continues to lend credence to the original false charges by memorializing the comfort women in a monument in New Jersey and a street name in New York. Not only is this perpetrating historical untruths, but it also leads unnecessary racial conflict and suffering of people of Japanese ancestry.\nWe strongly request President Obama to remove the monument and not to support any international harassment related to this issue against the people of Japan.\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

The fact that this famous tourist city has more than six million populations and receives a large number of foreign tourists including Americans makes the situation much more worrisome.

However one of the Students that is suppose to present to him has been denied the right to present all because of his status which is undocumented. That Student is Francisco Martinez. He has over 20 hours of college credit. Has received multiple awards in both business and technology on top of being a model student. When we here President Obama's Plan for a Path to Citizenship of 11 Million Undocumented Students and Workers, Francisco Martinez is exactly who we think of. He's pledged allegiance to our Flag, is here through no fault of his own and Francisco Martinez deserves his chance to make his case in front of the President of the United States of America.\nIt's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.
